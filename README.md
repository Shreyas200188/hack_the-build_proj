# Know your Disease and Doc
## Prediction of ailment using symptoms and depression symptoms

**What does this app do?**

When a person is ill, usually he/she consults a general physician who then the prognosis for the disease. Often it happens that the patient is then referred to a specialist doctor for that particular disease. This app predicts the most likely disease(s) that the user is suffering using the symptoms as inputs and can help in reaching the right doctor in a more time-efficient manner.  Not only does this app predict diseases but also predicts whether the user is suffering from depression.

**What are challenges we faced?**

The biggest challenge was finding a good dataset which has the right balance of the number of features and the variety of diseases. 
We had trouble integrating the app which was made using flutter and the ML model which was made on google collaboratory.
